# Project-1-About-Muhammad
We were presented with a task to reflect what we have learned in the past 1 month on HTML and CSS.
I took the opportunity to create an on-line resume that will showcase my current and new skills to my potential employers. 
I decided to built an online-resume because It is something that I feel that I can build on after the course and further demonstrate my technical abilities as a programmer.
I decided to go for a simple, fresh and easy to navigate webpage so that the user can easily find out facts about myself. I chose a blue theme because blue is my favourite color



# demo link

Click on the link to navigate to my page

the site can be accessed via [ https://muhammad-mo.github.io/Project-1-About-Muhammad/]

# User Interface
The goal of the site is to enable the user to find out interesting and useful facts about me without any hassle

# Programming languages Used

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap 

# Features
The overall website's look is achieved as planned. 
Users are able to navigate to the different pages of the site and external links will open in a different tab
Users will be able to see the color animation of the background pages changing into different shades of blue

# Features left to implement
The website did not respond particularly well to iphone 6/7/8 and plus models particularly well and this will need to be further developed

# Testing
The mouser over function turns opaque when moused over and the button changes color after being clicked.

The page was built with flexbox function in mind and works as intended

The "My Favourite Website" section has links which will bring the user to 6 different websites when being clicked

The page has a total of 4 seperate sections and the links work as intended

The video played out accordingly

The website responded to different browser sizes


# Deployment

My site was deployed using Github's paltform via this link
[ https://muhammad-mo.github.io/Project-1-About-Muhammad/]

The one difference in the deployed version is that the video is not shown in the index page.
