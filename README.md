# Project-1-About-Muhammad
We were presented with a task to reflect what we have learned in the past 1 month on HTML and CSS.
I took the opportunity to create an on-line resume that will showcase my current and new skills to my potential employers. 
I decided to built an online-resume because It is something that I feel that I can build on after the course and further demonstrate my technical abilities as a programmer.
I decided to go for a simple, fresh and easy to navigate webpage so that the user can easily find out facts about myself. I chose a blue theme because blue is my favourite color

# demo link

CLick on the link to navigate to my page

# User Interface
The goal of the site is to enable the user to find out interesting and useful facts about me without any hassle

# Programming languages Used

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap 

# Features
The overall website's look is achieved as planned. Improvements could be made to each pages by putting in animations and adding more sections


# Testing
The mouser over function turns opaque when moused over and the button changes color after being clicked.

The page was built with flexbox function in mind and works as intended

The "My Favourite Website" section has icons which will bring the user to 5 different websites when being clicked and the boxes turns opaque when being hovered

The page has a total of 4 seperate sections and the links work as attended

The Animation was planned so that the top part of the page will change in color over 15 seconds
