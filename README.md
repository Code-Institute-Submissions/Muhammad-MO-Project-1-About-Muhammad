# Project-1-About-Muhammad
We were presented with a task to reflect what we have learned in the past 1 month on HTML and CSS.
I took the opportunity to create an on-line resume that will showcase my current and new skills to my potential employers. 
I decided to built an online-resume because It is something that I feel that I can build on after the course and further demonstrate my technical abilities as a programmer.
I decided to go for a simple, fresh and easy to navigate webpage so that the user can easily find out facts about myself. I chose a blue theme because blue is my favourite color

# demo link

CLick on the link to navigate to my page

# User Interface
The goal of the site is to enable the user to find out interesting and useful facts about me without any hassle

# Programming languages Used

1. HTML
2. CSS
